Build an AngularJS app that lets the user enter a name, stores it, and then lets them display
what they entered earlier.

● Create a service named NameService. It has two methods, getName and setName,
which get and set a “name” variable inside the service.

● Create a component named nameForm. It has an input and a “Save” button. When the
form is submitted, it calls the setName method of the NameService.

● Create a component named nameDisplay. It has a “Load” button. When the button is
clicked, it calls the getName method of the NameService and displays the result.

● Add both components to index.html.
